## Solution
As the name suggests, this will be about [robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard).

http://web5.tamuctf.com/robots.txt
```
User-agent: *

WHAT IS UP, MY FELLOW HUMAN!
HAVE YOU RECEIVED SECRET INFORMATION ON THE DASTARDLY GOOGLE ROBOTS?!
YOU CAN TELL ME, A FELLOW NOT-A-ROBOT!
```

Let's change the `User-agent` request header to [whatever google robot uses](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062596).

We can use https://apitester.com/.

## Solution
[hello_world.cpp](hello_world.cpp) is a program written in [Whitespace (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)).

Let's run it in an interpreter https://vii5ard.github.io/whitespace/ and see what it prints. 
```
Well sweet golly gee, that sure is a lot of whitespace!
```
But there's more characters on the stack, we just need to add more print statements (two spaces and tab).
